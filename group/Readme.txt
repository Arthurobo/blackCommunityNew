In my group detail view where i have list of groups, i added the function that prevents page reload because
once i like a post in a group and then reload my page with Ctrl R, group posts when liked or unliked takes
to the detail page which is not what i want to happen. I don't want a situation where users are able
to view the detail page of a group post. I want it to have the ability that every post should be displayed
with their respective comments.

This is a bug and once it's resolved, I will make it possible for Ctrl R to work.
